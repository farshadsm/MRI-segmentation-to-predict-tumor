# MRI-segmentation-to-predict-tumor
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced imaging technique that is used to observe a variety of diseases and parts of the body. In this project, I've built a neural network based on the 3D U-Net architecture to automatically segment tumor regions in the brain, using MRI scans. The model is able to identify regions of the image that contain tumor cells.
